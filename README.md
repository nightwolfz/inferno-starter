<p>&nbsp;</p>

The goal of this project is to provide a starting base for an mobx inferno project with isomorphism.

Features:
+ `async/await` support
+ CSS and SCSS compilation
+ MongoDB user register/login/logout
+ Token based authentication
+ Decorators for accessing actions and state
+ Hot reload
+ Bundle size as small as possible
+ Offline support through service workers

## How to run

For development:

    npm run dev

For production:

    npm run prod

## Requirements

    Node 6+ (or Node 4 with additional babel plugins)
    MongoDB server

## Goals

- Optimized for minimal bundle size.
- Optimized for server-side speed. (See the benchmark, it's fast !)
- Using Inferno, the fastest React-like framework out there. 
- Using MobX, the easiest and insanely fast state manager.
- Simple and minimal with routing, authentication, database and server-side rendering.
- Good developer experience with hot-reloading and source-maps.
- Get to 100% score on Google Lighthouse

# F.A.Q.

## What are `stores` ?

State contains the state of your application (ex: list of your todos, UI state etc).
Stores contain the methods that mutate that state (ex: adding a todo, fetching data).
Technically our State object is also a store, but we make the differentiation so that our logic is easier to follow by using the same principes as redux (one big state object).

## How to access our `state` and `stores` in our components ?

```js
@connect('state', 'store')
class MyComponent extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    const { state, store } = this.props
    store.account.doSomething();
  }

  render({ state, store }) {
     return <div>{state.account.username}</div>
  }
}
```

## What is `connect` ?

The `@connect` decorator injects stores into your components.
Additionally, it keeps your components up to date with any changes in your stores.

_Example: If you display a `messageCount` from a `Messages` store and it gets updated, 
then all the visible components that display that `messageCount` will update themselves._


## Does connecting many components make my app slower?

**No**, it actually allows the rendering to be done more efficiently. So connect as many as you want !


## Adding mongoose models

1. Goto `src/server/models`
2. Add `[Name].js` with your model in it

## Adding stores

1. Goto `src/stores`
2. Add `[Name].js` (it's just a class, ex: `Account.js`)
3. Update `src/config/context.js`

## My components are not updating!

Make sure you added the `@connect` decorator to your component.

## My stateless component doesn't have access to the stores !

You cannot use decorators on stateless components.
You should instead wrap your component like this:

```js
// Simple observable component without injection
const MyComponent = connect(props => {
  return <p>Something is cool</p>
})

// or with injection into props
const MyComponent = connect('state', 'store')(props => {
  return <p>We have stores and state in our props: {props.state.something}</p>
})
````
